Just been to see the bounty hunter!!! Seriously @username  what were you thinking iv just paid £6.45 I want a refund please
@username You werent there!!! ={ we watched BOUNTY HUNTER...it sucked, it was long, boring, Nelly looked like she was bout to fall asleep =}
Hey it's pretty much as bad as the Bounty Hunter but with slightly younger actors http://bit.ly/ar2Lvs
Clash of the Titans. Bad remake, bad mythology. Bleh.
Just caught Clash of the Titans. Uneven. Middling. But not BAD. (@ Megabox ??????) http://4sq.com/aAZ18H
@username What about Clash of the Titans?  I heard it sucks but.. dunno.
clash of the titans sucked ass D: I'm so dissapointed.
@username Smith is whining about critics seeing films for free.  It shouldn't and doesn't matter, really.  Cop Out is still awful.
ok #FYI that movie *THE CRAZIES* suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks dick... what the fuck... ended so stupid...
Wasted 2 hours of my life, saw &quot;Dear John&quot; w/ wifey n frnds, it should be &quot;DEAR LORD&quot; seriously! Dnt watch it! @username @username @username
@username nigga idgaf lmaoo dear john is wild depressing tho
@username I heard about Dear John... Kind of glad I didn't waste $9.25!
(1/2) @username &quot;I kind of wish they would stop making boring shit like Dear John.&quot; Why? Make 'em all, I say. If people don't wanna go
DEAR JOHN was estupid ......noelia agrees roberto thinks it was sentimental.....no!
Film review: Dear John = shite.  People who go to see Dear John = morons. No I haven't seen it.
I have seen the worst movie ever made and it's name is &quot;dear john.&quot; my intelligence has never been more insulted...
I hated 'Edge of Darkness' &amp; 'The Wolfman'. I think i'm done with multiplex cinemas. Majority of the movies no longer appeal to me.
Verdict about Edge of Darkness: Two thumbs WAY down.
Why is it that I only seem to get free t-shirts for movies I don't like?  No ma'am, I didn't like Edge of Darkness, but the shirt was free.
Edge of Darkness 3/10 i want my money back!!!
Back from seeing edge of darkness. Bit rubbish.
Just watched From Paris with Love. Dumb move on my part. How that movie got green lit is beyond me.
From Paris with love is a terrible movie.. Lol
From Paris With Love: *** Dull average dumb action film saved by a scenery chewing Travolta.
From Paris with love is so LAME ;/
From Paris with Love. Waste of my fcukin time!
Saw 'Ghost Writer' today. Was thoroughly confused the entire time.
@username nope.. Legion sucks . Not even worth an illegal download
Writing up a review of Legion. Sneak preview: it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Possibly the worst. Like, Transformers 2 bad.
Legion: not good. Especially when half the chairs in your theater are covered with trash bags, and you just heard rumors of bedbugs. Eep.
@username I saw Legion yesterday. It sucked :( No plot and no angels in trench coats xD
Saw #legion at the movies last night. Sucked. There... I just saved you money.
Dis movie legion a fool!
So frustrated with this movie LEGION, ugh!!!!
Legion is a terrible movie and anyone who spends more than the time it takes to download it off the internet is crazy.
I'm watching that one movie Legion... &quot;I THINK IS CRAPY&quot; But my brother seems to like it.. O,.,o
Had a fantastic long date tonight with @username: saw H.M.S. Pinafore, had steak and ribs for dinner, and saw an awful movie (Legion).
Disappointed by Legion. It was better if this flick just stayed as trailer
owww and the movie #LEGION sucks balllllssss
Just watched Legion!!!!not  up to much:-(?
#random I'm glad I didn't go pay to see legion wack 2 infinity and beyond ugh!
&quot;Legion&quot; looks a little over the top, but I do like Adrianne Palicki... we will see
thsi movie Legion sucks and dk y im still watchin
saw 'Shutter Island' this weekend... and it was horrible.... but maybe because i was sleepy.. ;-)
@username Even if I saw &quot;Shutter Island&quot; with free passes, I would demand my money back!
OMG, Don't go see Shutter Island! HATED IT (stumping my feet &amp; swinging my hair while rolling my eyes)...I want my money back!
shutter island ....  DISAPPOINTMENT.  but  im  tough  on  movies...  it  wasn't  all  bad.. ehh  I  don't  want  to  ruin  it..  lol.
Some movies that were popular failed to impress me, wonder why - the latest in the list being 'Shutter Island'. I think I am too dumb for it
since 1995 a well-known director named Martin Scorsese continues to make bad movies, Shutter Island is his latest &quot;shitepiece&quot;.
Saw Shutter Island yesterday. That's two hours of my life I'll never get back. \#martyhasreallygoneofftheboil
Shutter Island was a #lowblow. Not what I expected.
RT @username: Martin Scorsese took a dump and named it Shutter Island. Voila.
@username my head hurts from Shutter Island
Shutter Island is a fucked up movie.
@username I thought &quot;Shutter Island&quot; was pretty crappy.  Not scary, creepy or innovative.  Mildly entertaining is my verdict.
I saw ''Shutter Island ''....finally. Some Shocking Scenes, wasnt what I expected.
RT @username: I want to go see shutter island ... « Plz don't , that is a bad movie ..sooo overrated
Watching the tooth fairy, its quite rubbish :)
@username mom ken ava... i went to see the tooth fairy... it was stupid i wanted to see avatar... and no, i've decided i don't want one.
@username For sure. I was more looking for something to break up the snow days. Thank God I was saved from having to see Tooth Fairy!
Ok, the Tooth Fairy was lame. Kids will love it. Adults won't. At least Ashley Judd was n it :) Rock was good but movie was a cheese fest
at the movies with the kids. Tooth fairy sucks, I can hardly sit through it
Who watched Valentine's Day? I'm gonna watch it soon. But It seems to be a fake Love Actually ...
Valentine's Day was NOT a fairytale. Haha, that was a horrible movie!
I am watching Valentine's Day. This movie is really lame. However, Taylor Swift is in this stupid thing and she is attractive.
Eastgardens is the place to be;ran into @username while killing time. Now off to see The.Worst.Movie.Ever aka Valentine's Day w @username
Lmao we saw when in rome and drew and I got bored so we snuck out and went shopping and got back right on time &amp; nobody even noticed Ü___Ü
Btw I saw #wolfman yesterday and it sucked
Last night I say the movie #wolfman and to be honest I don't know if I could recomend this movie. Not what I expected!!!
Last night I saw the Wolfman, more like the Worst, Man! The movie was worse than that joke I just made.
WOLFMAN was one of The worst movies I done see in awhile. A waste of Atlantic station trip lol
All's Well End's Well Too 2010  and Wolfman isn't a good movie!
I saw Wolfman last night. What a terribly mediocre movie.
not too impressed with The Wolfman.  I all-star cast but the plot never really came together for me.
Just got back from watching The Wolfman. That movie SUCKED! Severely disappointed.
the wolfman is bringing nothing new to the story .. thus why im bored by the movie
@username nooooo I beg of you don't see wolfman! It was terrible enough now I'll have to experience that pain again via Brent and cole
Wolfman was...gross. I thought it was PG-13 and it was actually R. And Benico Del Toro cannot carry a movie by himself.
chilled out Sunday. Saw wolfman. Boringly scary. Ate at New York New York. It wasn't the same! :(
The Wolfman was a terrible movie
I really want my ticket money back. #Wolfman was some bullshit! That movie had so much potential and they just made some bullshit.
